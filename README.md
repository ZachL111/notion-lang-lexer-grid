# notion-lang-lexer-grid

`notion-lang-lexer-grid` treats compilers as a local verification problem. The Julia implementation is intentionally narrow, but the fixtures and notes make the behavior explicit.

## Notion Lang Lexer Grid Checkpoints

Treat the compact fixture as the contract and the extended examples as a scratchpad. The code should stay boring enough that a change in behavior is obvious from the test output.

## What This Is For

This is not a wrapper around a service. It is a self-contained project that shows how the model behaves when demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight move in different directions.

## Useful Pieces

- Models source form with deterministic scoring and explicit review decisions.
- Uses fixture data to keep intermediate state changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for bytecode output, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents evaluation checks tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.

## Architecture Notes

The project is organized around a compact model rather than a large framework. Inputs are scored, classified, and checked against golden fixtures. The constants live in code and are mirrored in metadata so documentation drift is easy to catch. The Julia project keeps the model in a small module with assertions in a local test script.

## Project Layout

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Tooling

Install Julia and run the commands from the repository root. The project does not need credentials or a hosted service.

## Local Workflow

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Quality Gate

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Case Study

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `surge` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## Scope

The fixture set is deliberately small. That keeps the review surface clear, but it also means the model should not be treated as a complete domain simulator.

## Expansion Ideas

- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add one more compilers fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
